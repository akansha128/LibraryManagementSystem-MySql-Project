## Objective 
This SQL project aims to enhance database querying skills by performing operations using various SQL functions, 
including aggregate functions, joins, subqueries, string functions, and datetime functions. Through hands-on execution of
these queries, the project explores data manipulation, retrieval, and transformation techniques. The objective is to develop
a strong understanding of SQL concepts and their practical applications in data analysis.
